# Tips for preparing LaTeX articles

Equations
---------
For mathematical equations, use `amssymb` and `amsmath` packages and follow the instructions in Short Math Guide for LATEX by Michael Downes at ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf.

UTF characters
--------------
To find and remove UTF characters from your text (e.g. when they show up after copying and pasting something from MS Word) use `[^\x00-\x7F]` regex in sublime text find or replace bar. Make sure the regular expression option, which looks like `.*` in find bar of sublime text, is active.

Figures
-------
PDF files can contain both bitmap and vector graphics and be generated by most software or PDF printers. All major journals accept PDF figures, and they can be easily imported into the article using `graphicx` package. Particularly, to use PowerPoint drawings for use in LaTeX follow this detailed instruction: https://www.cs.bu.edu/~reyzin/pictips.html

Units
-----
To type physical quantities with their units, use `siunitx` package e.g. `\SI{12}{\micro\second}`.
